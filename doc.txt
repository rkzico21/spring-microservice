Dependencies

1. Java 8

2. Maven:
    This is a maven project. So install and configure maven to build the packages.

    Maven installer: both linux and windows installer can be found in this link http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.5.0/binaries/.
    
	Installation and Configuration:  
      Windows: https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/
	  http://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac
  
  
    Once mvn is configured then run following command from root directory of all the packages(i.e registry, apigateway, todolist, user) which will download necessary dependencies.
	
	mvn clean install.
	
	
  
3. Postgresql: 
    "user" and "todolist" services are dependent on postgresql. install postgresql and create two databases "userdb" and "todolistdb"
	 
	Make sure following properties is set to true in application.properties file
	 
	spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

	When you run the services it will create the required tables.

	Once the tables are created you can change the property value to "update" so it does not throw away old tables.
	
	
	Configure the following properties in applicatio.properties file accoring to postgres setup
	
	spring.datasource.username=DATABASEUSER(default postgres)
    spring.datasource.password=PASSWORD
   
    
	Installer: https://www.postgresql.org/download/ 
   
  
	
4. Memcached:
    "todolist" service is dependent on memcached. So make sure memcached is running before starting todolistservice.
 
    Unix installer : http://www.memcached.org/downloads
    Windows : http://downloads.northscale.com/memcached-1.4.5-x86.zip (32 bit)   
              http://downloads.northscale.com/memcached-1.4.5-x86.zip (64 bit)


    For windows run memcached.exe  to start the memcached.



Running the service:
  You have to first start the registry service. Then you have to run other services.
  
  Example usage:
  
    From postman or similar http client you can send http request to test the services.
	
	
	get http://localhost:8888/api/user  (gets all the user)
	
    get http://localhost:8888/api/todolist?userid=1 (get todolists for the user with id 1)
	
	delete http://localhost:8888/api/todolist/1 (delete todolist with id 1)
